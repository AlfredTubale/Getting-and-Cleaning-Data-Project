# Code Book

## Goal of the project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
The folowing are required to submit: 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
4) You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. 

This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

## Activities required to be performed

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## Raw Data

The raw data for this project came from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
It was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The data can be downloaded here.

## Data Files

The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

## Transformation

To get from the Raw Data to the Tidy Data, transformations were made and can be executed with the script ‘run_analysis.R’.

## Tidy Dataset
The final dataset for this project consists of 1 file - “Tidydata.txt”.
